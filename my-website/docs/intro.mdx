# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This book is designed for students and developers eager to dive into the exciting world where artificial intelligence meets robotic systems, with a particular focus on humanoid platforms.

Over the course of this book, you will explore:

-   **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Understanding the foundational middleware for robotics.
-   **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Building and interacting with simulated robot environments.
-   **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Advanced perception and navigation using NVIDIA's powerful tools.
-   **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrating LLMs, perception, and ROS 2 for intelligent robot behaviors.
-   **Capstone Project**: Bringing it all together into an end-to-end Voice → Plan → Navigate → Detect → Manipulate pipeline.

This book aims to provide clear, technically accurate, and reproducible examples to help you build a solid understanding and practical skills in this rapidly evolving field. We encourage you to follow along with the code examples and exercises to maximize your learning.
